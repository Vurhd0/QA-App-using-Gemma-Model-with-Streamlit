# QA-App-using-Gemma-Model-with-Streamlit
Built an interactive question-answering web app using LangChain, Streamlit, and the locally hosted Gemma:2B model via Ollama. Integrated a custom prompt template and used StrOutputParser to cleanly extract model responses. Managed API keys and LangChain tracing with .env configuration for better observability.
